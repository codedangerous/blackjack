This is just a simple Blackjack CLI game. It'll ask for your name, ask if 
you're ready to be dealt in, and then you can play as many games as you'd like 
until you decide to quit.

In order to run the game, you need the source code downloaded locally and you 
need to have Python installed on your system. When you have both of those, all 
you need to do is open a terminal, navigate to the blackjack directory 
wherever you put it on your system, and then run the main.sh file in the root 
of the directory (note: you may need to grant main.sh executable permission 
before you're able to run it).
